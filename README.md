# random-little-projects
A collection of all of my random projects that have as specific use case... just for me. But if you have similar interests - some of it may be useful.

## A little more info

This repo will be filled with folders of small projects that I've made to fix a specific issue that I've wanted to tackle and there just aren't any solutions out there.

For example, a network device monitor that publishes to MQTT whenever a specific device logs in, for my smart home stuff.

Maybe to someone something in here will be useful, but it's mainly just so I can easily deploy them to my server :)
